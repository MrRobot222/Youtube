# Firefox and Tor Browser 

## What is it in this topic?
 #### Most of the newbies who are new to kali don't know much about firefox(default).
 #### By default you get firefox-esr(extended supprt release), which is used to manage team like custom versions. sometimes you may have seen something like `Your browser is being managed by your organization` like below.

 ![Your browser is bein managed by your organization](https://github.com/MrRobot222/Youtube/blob/main/Firefox_x_Tor_install/images/1)

     NOTE: This kinda browser get's it's update once 6 motnhs only

#### So most of us don't know much and we let that it be. To get rid of this we need new brower, but as a hacker we never liked chrome (I think still some likes chrome). So we choose firefox and tor as our secured browser. It's hard to install firefox than any other browser in kali linux `But from now don't google and waste your time`
